I decided to focus on the reserving seats functionality of the question. I built a simple front end UI component that allows a user to select their departing city then their destination city. It allows them to choose the amount of tickets they want then display a simple message to them displaying their selection. I liked this aspect of the app and there is so much more that I could possiblly include. I wanted to focus more on the mocha testing and undestanding how the whole process works.
